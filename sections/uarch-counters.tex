\chapter{Micro-architectural Counters}

The current RISC-V gcc toolchain provides access to 16 named ``uarch" counters.\footnote{The future plan of record is to move these counters into the memory-mapped access region. This will open up the ability to track a much larger number of counters, as desired.}

\begin{table}[htdp]
\caption{Uarch Counters}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Number & Event \\
\hline
\hline
0 & Committed Branch Mispredictions \\
\hline
1 & Committed Branches \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{table:uarchcounters}
\end{table}%

The counters can be modified in {\tt dpath.scala}. 

Note: the counters can be quite large (64-bits each), and it is recommended that alternative methods be used if a silicon BOOM is the end-product. A design that can multiplex counters is recommended.
