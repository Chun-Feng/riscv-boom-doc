\chapter{The Rename Stage}

The rename stage maps the {\em ISA} (or {\em logical}) register specifiers of each instruction to {\em physical} register specifiers.

\section{The Purpose of Renaming}

{\em Renaming} is a technique to rename the ISA (or {\em logical}) register specifiers in an instruction by mapping them to a new space of {\em physical} registers.  The goal to {\em register renaming} is to break the output- (WAW) and anti-dependences (WAR) between instructions, leaving only the true dependences.  Said again, but in architectural terminology, register renaming eliminates write-after-write (WAW) and write-after-read (WAR) hazards, which are artifacts introduced by a) only having a limited number of ISA registers to use as specifiers and b) loops, which by their very nature will use the same register specifiers on every loop iteration. 

\section{The Explicit Renaming Design}

BOOM is an ``explicit renaming" or ``physical register file" out-of-order core design.  A physical register file, containing many more registers than the ISA dictates, holds both the committed architectural register state and speculative register state. The rename map tables contain the information needed to recover the committed state. As instructions are renamed, their register specifiers are explicitly updated to point to physical registers located in the physical register file. The MIPS R10k, Alpha 21264, Intel Sandy Bridge, and ARM Cortex A15 cores are all example of explicit renaming out-of-order cores.

\end{figure}


This is in contrast to an ``implicit renaming" or ``data-in-ROB" out-of-order core design.  The Architectural Register File (ARF) only holds the committed register state, while the ROB holds the speculative write-back data.  On commit, the ROB transfers the speculative data to the ARF. 

The Pentium 4 and the ARM Cortex A57 are examples of {\em implicit renaming} designs.

For superscalar rename, any changes to the map tables must be bypassed to dependent instructions. The physical source specifiers can then read the Busy Table. The {\em Stale} specifier is used to track which physical register will be freed when the instruction later commits. P0 in the Physical Register File is always 0.}

\section{The Rename Map Tables}

The Rename Map Tables hold the speculative mappings from ISA registers to physical registers.  

Each branch gets its own copy of the rename map tables.\footnote{An alternate design for wider pipelines may prefer to only make up to one snapshot per cycle, but this comes with additional complexity to deduce the precise mappings for any given instruction within the fetch packet.}  On a branch mispredict, the map table can be reset instantly from the mispredicting branch's copy of the map table. 

As the RV64G ISA uses fixed locations of the register specifiers (and no implicit register specifiers), the map tables can be read before the instruction is decoded!  

\subsection{Resets on Exceptions and Flushes}


An additional, optional ``Committed Map Table" holds the rename map for the committed architectural state.  If enabled, this allows single-cycle reset of the pipeline during flushes and exceptions (the current map table is reset to the committed map table). 


\section{The Busy Table}

The Busy Table tracks the readiness status of each physical register. If all physical operands are ready, the instruction will be ready to be issued. 

\section{The Free List}

The free-list tracks the physical registers that are currently un-used and is used to allocate new physical registers to instructions passing through the {\em Rename} stage.  

The Free List is implemented as a bit-vector.  A priority decoder can then be used to find the first free register. BOOM uses a cascading priority decoder to allocate multiple registers per cycle.\footnote{A two-wide rename stage could use two priority decoders starting from opposite ends.}

On every branch (or jalr), the rename map tables are snapshotted to allow single-cycle recovery on a branch misprediction. Likewise, the Free List also sets aside a new ``Allocation List", initialized to zero.  As new physical registers are allocated, the Allocation List for each branch is updated to track all of the physical registers that have been allocated after the branch. If a misspeculation occurs, its Allocation List is added back to the Free List by {\em OR'ing} the branch's Allocation List with the Free List. 

\section{Stale Destination Specifiers}

For instructions that will write a register, the map table is read to get the {\em stale physical destination specifier} (``stale pdst").  Once the instruction commits, the {\em stale pdst} is returned to the free list, as no future instructions will read it.

%\section{Handling Branch Mispredictions}
%
%Every instruction in the pipeline has a ``branch mask", which is a bit-vector describing each live branch that it is currently being speculated under. Each branch is allocated a ``branch tag", and a corresponding branch mask bit such that every following instruction will have that corresponding bit set in its own branch mask.  Once a branch is resolved, the corresponding branch mask bit is cleared in every instruction's branch-mask. If the branch is misspeculated, then all instructions with the corresponding branch mask bit is killed.
