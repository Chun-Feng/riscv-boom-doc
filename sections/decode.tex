\chapter{The Decode Stage}

The decode stage takes instructions from the fetch buffer, decodes them, and allocates the necessary resources as required by each instruction.  The decode stage will stall as needed if not all resources are available.

%\TODO{discuss parameterization, and the coupling of fetch width to decode width}.

%\TODO{discuss allocating branch tags and branch mask bits and other resources?}
